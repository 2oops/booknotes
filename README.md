You have 86400 RMB in your account

One day somebody steals 10 RMB

Will you be upset

and throw all of the 86390 RMB away

or will you just move on

Right, normally people will move on

Actually we also have 86400 seconds every single day

So don't let someone's negative 10 seconds

ruin the rest 86390s

Don't be sad for the small stuff

our life is bigger than that
